## Quick Start

### For Users
1. Open any discussion you own or have permission to bump
2. Click the **"Bump"** button at the bottom of the discussion
3. The discussion moves to the top of the discussion list

### For Admins
Navigate to **Admin ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Bump** to configure:

#### Manual Bump Tab
- **Enable Manual Bump**: Allow discussion owners to manually bump their discussions
- **Cooldown Hours**: Time users must wait between bumps
  - Set to `-1` to disable bumps
  - Set to `0` for no cooldown
  - Set to a positive number for hours (e.g., 24 = once per day)
- **Daily Quota**: Maximum bumps per day for discussion owners
  - Set to `-1` to disable bumps
  - Set to `0` for unlimited
  - Set to a positive number for daily limit
- **Weekly Quota**: Maximum bumps per week for discussion owners
  - Set to `-1` to disable bumps
  - Set to `0` for unlimited
  - Set to a positive number for weekly limit
- **Available in Tags**: Select which tags allow manual bumping (empty = all tags)
- **Moderator Groups**: Select groups that can bump ANY discussion and bypass all restrictions

#### Absorber Tab
- **Enable Absorber**: Prevent discussions from being bumped too frequently by new posts
- **Time Threshold**: Minimum hours required between discussion creation and allowing auto-bumps from new posts
  - Set to `0` to disable absorber
  - For example, setting to 2 means new posts won't bump the discussion for the first 2 hours after creation
- **Apply to Tags**: Select specific tags where absorber should be active (empty = all tags)
- **Bypass Groups**: Select groups whose posts will always bump discussions immediately

#### Group Overrides Tab
Customize settings for specific user groups (overrides global settings):
- **Manual Bump Settings**: Override cooldown, daily quota, and weekly quota per group
- **Absorber Settings**: Override absorber threshold per group
- Leave fields empty to use global defaults
- Set to `0` for unlimited/bypass
- Priority: Group settings > Global defaults

#### Recent Activity Tab
View recent bump activity with details:
- Discussion title and link
- Bump type (Manual/Automatic/Absorber)
- User who performed the bump
- Timestamp

## üéØ Use Cases

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Group Override Priority
Settings are resolved in this order:
1. **Group Override** (if user belongs to group with override)
2. **Global Default** (if no group override applies)

### Manual Bump Behavior
- **Cooldown**: Time restriction applies per discussion, not globally
- **Quotas**: Reset based on rolling time windows (not midnight)
  - Daily quota: Last 24 hours from current time
  - Weekly quota: Last 7 days from current time
  - Quotas are tracked per user across all discussions
- **Moderator Groups**: Can bump ANY discussion and bypass all cooldown/quota restrictions

### Absorber Behavior
- **Threshold Check**: Based on discussion age (time since creation), not last bump time
- **First Bump**: First post always allowed to bump the discussion
- **Manual Bump Protection**: When absorber blocks a post, it preserves any manual bumps
- **Bypass Options**:
  - Global bypass groups: Users in these groups always bump discussions
  - Group override threshold 0: Per-group absorber bypass
- **Tag Control**: Works only on selected tags (or all if empty)

### Cache Management
The extension automatically clears all caches when you save settings in admin panel.

If you modify database values manually, run:
```bash
php flarum cache:clear
```

After saving settings, refresh forum pages (F5) to load new settings.
